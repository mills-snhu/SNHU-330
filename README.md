Computer Graphics and Visualization

How do I approach designing software?
By using the user and client's requirements as the basis of the sofware design, then shaping the functionality of the sofware around the requirements.


What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Coding in small sections at a times, then test that section. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Start with basic shapes and basic arrangement of objects, then work on colors and textures, then lighting, and finally add final details to objects and final spacial arrangement. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
working with small amountsis helpful to prevent wasted time looking for causes of errors. Changing too much at one time can lead to more confusion if an error occurs and the cause takes up alot of time to figure out. 


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I did not have any new strategies


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science can help me by allowing me to develope programs or adjust programs to the specifications needed for certain projects. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This area will be helpful in learning how to apply the graaphics to Geographical Information System programs

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
if needed I could make visual graphics for a small project
